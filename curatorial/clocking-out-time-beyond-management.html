                    <p><i>Clocking Out: Time Beyond Management</i> challenges the dominant modern conception of time as objective, divisible, and linear. Situating the global imposition of this naturalized temporal order alongside the advent of Western capitalist modernity and the implementation of standardized clock time, the exhibition explores how time is represented, lived, and contested in the catastrophic present.</p>
                    
                    <p>Presenting speculative, historical, and already-existing alternatives to the dominant temporal regime, the exhibition gestures towards a <i>Time Beyond Management</i>—a time outside of imposed regimentations, imperatives to productivity, and self-inflicted time management. The works on view foreground the orchestration of time as a site of struggle and critique, moving away from linear, progressive conceptions of time that historically and continuously enable interlocking systems of social, political, and economic domination. Spanning decolonial and Indigenous temporalities, alternative time-based economies, queered timekeeping devices, and materializations of interwoven time in textile practices, the exhibition resists the tendency towards a singular counter-hegemonic solution. <i>Clocking Out</i> is ultimately an invitation to imagine liberatory futures unhinged from the clock’s regulative hold on everyday life.</p>
